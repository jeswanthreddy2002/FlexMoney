**Description**
The Admission Form web application enables users to enroll for admission by providing their personal details such as name, email, age (restricted between 18 to 65), and preferred batch timing among four available slots: 6-7AM, 7-8AM, 8-9AM, and 5-6PM. Upon enrollment, users are directed to a payment page to complete the admission process.

The logic implemented allows participants to choose any batch within a month and switch to another batch in subsequent months. Users can shift between batches in different months, but within the same month, they need to remain in the selected batch. The signup and login pages help identify returning users, enabling functionality like batch preference changes and payment.
